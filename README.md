# CoinSeek

CoinSeek is a competing [DragonHack](https://dragonhack.si/) 2024 mobile app.

## Setup

## Firebase
The app uses Firebase as a backend (with cloud functions) so running the app requires a Firebase projet.

To run/build the app you need to have the required configuration files for Firebase, which can be added with the FlutterFire CLI.

If using the FlutterFire CLI you need to run:
```
flutterfire configure --project=<project_id>
```
